Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
  It enables creation of software applications & systems thatpwer various aspects of modern life such as communication,commerce,entertainment & healthcare.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Structured programming made in the 1960s                           Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
  Programming languages such as Fortran & C were developed
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   Requirements:Gathering user needs                   Implementation:Writing code & building the software               Deployment:Releasing to the public
   Design:Crafting detailed design of the software architecture  Testing:Conducting tests to confirm quality 7 requirements  Maintenance:Providing support & updates
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Both are necessary to the software in question                Waterfall can be used in software which is permanent while Agile can be used for ever-changing software so as
   Waterfall has distinct stages while Agile has none              to stay relevant.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    Software Developer:Writes code & implements software solutions.                            Project Manager:Oversees planning execution and delivery of software projects.
    Quality Assurance Engineer:Ensures softwar quality through desingning and executing plans.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging & testing code e.g.Visual Studio,Eclipse.
    VCS are tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g.Git,Subversion.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Changing requirements,tight deadlines and technical debt.
       These can be overcome through effective communication,agile methodologies and regular reassessment of goals and timelines among others.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.                                              Unit testing:testing individual components or modules of software.                                                                                                              Integration testing:Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.       
    System testing:Testing the entire software system as a whole.                                                                                                                   Acceptance testing:Testing the software against user requirements.        These stages are necessary so as to ensure a smooth experience btn the software and the people.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best responses from AI models. 
    This avoids ambiguous questions and answers by making question clear and specific.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  What is art?     Why is music considered as art?    The second propmt is effective because I want a clear explanation of music as part of art.
